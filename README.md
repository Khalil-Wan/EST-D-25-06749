Codes of accuracy, robustness

1. The software version used in this paper is MATLAB R2022a.
2. GPR uses the GPML tool (gpml-matlab-v4.2-2018-06-11). You can download via https://github.com/zhouweiyan/gpml-matlab-v4.2-2018-06-11.git
3. XGBoost file is too large. So it cannot be uploaded.
4. EIS_data is the training set, EIS_data_35C02 is the testing set.
5. For the data, column 1 denotes temperature, column 2 to 121 denotes EIS, column 122 to 124 denotes CT, DT, CE, respectively.
